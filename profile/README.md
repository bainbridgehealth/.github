### Transforming Data into Action

Bainbridge Health was developed in The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and in collaboration with leading adult and pediatric hospitals. We help healthcare organizations unlock the value of medication data to prevent errors, reduce cost and optimize the pharmacy supply chain. Our goal is to close the gap between decisions being made “upstream”—in the supply chain or at clinical decision support—with real world clinical practice.

### Our Network

We are proud to partner with leading adult and pediatric hospitals that share our commitment to making medication safer and more efficient. To expand the learnings from our network, Bainbridge Health has a longstanding Memorandum of Understanding with the [Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP)](https://www.ismp.org/) to share de-identified real world data to improve the practice of medication use.

### Real World Results

Over 290 million medication transactions have been analyzed by Bainbridge Health’s Med O.S.® Technology Platform. Every day, our team of data and clinical professionals collaborate with teams at hospitals across the country to deliver real world results. Some examples include:

- 80% reduction in FTE time spent on data management.
- 70% reduction in nuisance alerts.
- $114K in waste eliminated for a single drug.
- 25% reduction in controlled substances dispensed to care areas.
- 37% decrease in clinical decision support overrides.
